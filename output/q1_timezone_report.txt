My original data from the dataframe of patient_vitals was in naive datetime. 
I localized the data using tz_localize('UTC') in order to add the timezone of UTC to the naive datetime in patient_vitals. 
I then converted the timezone in patient_vitals from 'UTC' to 'US/Eastern'. 
An issue that I encountered with DST is that when we try to convert to the timezone of US/Eastern, issues can arise due to daylight savings 
that happens with US/Eastern time. On the second Sunday of March every year, clocks skip one hour and go directly from 2:00 a.m. to
3 a.m. This means that 2:30 a.m. on this day is an invalid time, and this can cause ambiguity if we're trying to convert to US/Eastern time, but
the given time on the second Sunday of March we're trying to convert does not exist in US/Eastern time due to DST. Similarly, on the first Sunday every November, at 2 a.m. 
clocks move back one hour to 1 a.m. If we're tying to convert a time on the first Sunday of November to US/Eastern time, ambiguity can arise due to the 
repeated hour. Using UTC as the base timezone avoids these issues with DST because UTC doesn't observe DST, which means we have an unambiguous reference point. 
This means that pandas will be able to correctly calculate the local time for the new timezone and properly adjust for DST changes without ambiguity. 

Example: 
We have 
dst_date_utc = pd.Timestamp('2023-03-12 10:00:00', tz='UTC')  # UTC time avoids DST issues
print(dst_date_utc)
dst_time_eastern = dst_date_utc.tz_convert('US/Eastern')  # Convert UTC to Eastern
print(dst_time_eastern)

When we convert '2023-03-12 10:00:00' in UTC to US/Eastern, we get '2023-03-12 06:00:00-04:00'. We see that pandas takes into account that an hour is skipped 
on the Sunday of March for US/Eastern, causing US/Eastern to to trail UTC by 4 hours as part of DST.
